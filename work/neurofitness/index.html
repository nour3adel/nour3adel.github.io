        <h1>NeuroFitness App</h1>
        <h3 class="text">
          NeuroFitness is a cutting-edge Workout Helper app that leverages deep
          learning and AI to optimize your fitness routine. It accurately counts
          both correct and incorrect reps, provides real-time feedback, and
          classifies each exercise you perform. Your workouts are saved in your
          history, allowing you to track your progress over time.
        </h3>
        <p>
          Gym exercises are more complex than they appear, and proper movement
          is essential for both effectiveness and safety. Correct angles and
          techniques are crucial to avoid risks and potential injuries. While
          personal trainers can provide guidance, they can be expensive. This
          underscores the need for affordable and innovative solutions that can
          guide and correct movements during workouts. Improper form and
          technique can be particularly harmful, especially in weightlifting
          exercises, where injuries are most common.
        </p>
        <p>
          NeuroFitness app helps to ensure correct exercise form by using your
          camera or uploading video to track movements and verify proper
          execution. Receive instant feedback to correct your form in real-time,
          making workouts safer and more effective. The system adapts to
          different exercises in any gym environment. Track your progress over
          time, with the app saving and displaying your performance to keep you
          motivated.
        </p>
        <p>
          The NeuroFitness app features login, registration, and password
          recovery pages with OTP verification. It includes a comprehensive
          library covering 24 muscle groups, each with a variety of workouts
          targeting all body muscles. All workouts are stored in a database.
          Additionally, the app utilizes a classification model to identify and
          track the workouts you perform.
        </p>
        <p>
          After facing challenges with MySQL and PHP, and experiencing
          suboptimal performance with Flask for both backend and frontend, we
          transitioned to the Django framework. Django proved to be more
          efficient and better suited for our project requirements.
        </p>
        <p>
          Initially, we attempted to develop a model to evaluate the correctness
          of workouts. However, due to limited data and slow performance, the
          results were unsatisfactory. We then switched to using Mediapipe and
          mathematical techniques to measure angles and distances between body
          parts, which yielded better results. For classification, we
          experimented with various deep learning models and ultimately chose
          the pretrained Inception V3 model. We fine-tuned this model with
          customized callbacks and hyperparameters to meet our specific needs.
